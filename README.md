# Source and Channel Coding

A MATLAB-based project for implementing source and channel coding techniques in digital communication systems.  
The project demonstrates entropy analysis, compression (Huffman and Shannon–Fano), error correction with Hamming codes, and system performance evaluation under noise.

## Features

### Source Coding
- Compute symbol probabilities from text input.  
- Calculate entropy and fixed-length coding efficiency.  
- Implement Huffman encoder/decoder.  
- Implement Shannon–Fano encoder/decoder.  
- Compare coding efficiencies.  

### Channel Coding
- Implement (7,4) Hamming code encoder/decoder.  
- Simulate transmission over noisy channel with AWGN.  
- Plot BER vs SNR for coded and uncoded systems.  

### End-to-End System
- Integrate source and channel coding in a full communication chain.  
- Transmit, compress, protect, send over noisy channel, decode, and reconstruct text.  
- Compare transmitted vs received text at different SNR values.
